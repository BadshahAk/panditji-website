### Explanation:
1. **GitHub Username**: The username `BadshahAk` has been used to link your repository in the instructions.
2. **Vercel Button**: The "Deploy with Vercel" button will allow users to deploy your website directly on Vercel. You need to make sure your repository is public.
3. **Installation & Setup**: Instructions are provided for both PHP and Node.js setups.
4. **Deployment**: The Vercel deployment button will create a new project on Vercel from your GitHub repository.

You can now add this `README.md` file to your project and push it to GitHub. If you haven't already, make sure your repository is public so others can deploy it easily using the Vercel button.
